# Forecasting Tutorial

The recommended procedure is to use

```
python bin/driver.py input/external.ini
```

for external Fisher matrices (Planck, BAO, etc.) so that those get saved to `output/`.

Then use

```
python bin/lensing.py testExp lensing output/testFisher.txt
```

to create a Fisher matrix for the primary CMB and for Clkk and save this to `output/`.

Then you can use whatever combinations of the saved Fisher matrices in a separate script.

## External Fisher matrices

Typically, you will want to do something like this:

1. Include Planck TT only for l<30 over fsky=.65
2. Include Planck TT,TE,EE for 30<l<2500 over fsky=0.65 - fsky_exp, where fksy_exp is the fsky of the experiment you are forecasting for
3. Include a BOSS or DESI BAO Fisher matrix
4. Include a tau prior of 0.01 from Planck

You are encouraged to use bin/driver.py with input/external.ini to achieve 1-3. Manually add a tau prior yourself to the sum of your Fisher matrices at the end. driver.py lets you save each included section of input/external.ini as a txt file whose name you specify in external.ini. Please edit the commented lines in input/external.ini appropriately.


## Primary CMB + Lensing Clkk Fisher Matrix

For this, you should edit input/params.ini

and call, for e.g.,

```
python bin/lensing.py testExp lensing output/testFisher.txt
```

The first argument specifies the experiment by naming the section in input/params.ini that describes it. See the example testExp section.

The second argument specifies the lensing section name that describes what Clkk configuration to use. See the example `lensing` section.

The final argument specifies the name of the file to save this Fisher matrix to.

### Specifying an arbitrary noise file

You can override part of the experiment section (which only allows for instrumental whitenoise, beam and atmospheric lknee and alpha) with your choice of beam-deconvolved effective TT and EE/BB noise curves. You use the --tt and --pp options in lensing.py. E.g.

```
python bin/lensing.py testExp lensing output/testFisher.txt --tt noise_file_tt.txt --pp noise_file_pp.txt
```

The txt files should be two columns, the first with ells and the second with dimensionless beam-deconvolved noise. The ellmins and ellmaxes form the testExp section will still be used.


## Compiling all these together

Just read in these Fisher matrices and add them taking care of the parameter order. (Use orphics.stats.FisherMatrix class to make your life easier). Add a tau prior manually by adding 1./sigma_tau**2 to the tau element on the diagonal.
